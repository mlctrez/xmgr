# build steps

# I had to build from source since the distribution binary required a glibc version that I don't have


# as super user, install build dependencies according to the wiki page
# at  https://gitlab.com/xonotic/xonotic/-/wikis/Repository_Access ( next line is for Ubuntu )
sudo apt-get install autoconf automake build-essential curl git libtool libgmp-dev libjpeg-turbo8-dev libsdl2-dev libxpm-dev xserver-xorg-dev zlib1g-dev unzip zip

# create a separate user, xonotic for running the server
sudo adduser xonotic

# switch to that user
sudo su - xonotic

# as the xonotic user, clone the xonotic source and update
cd ~/
git clone https://gitlab.com/xonotic/xonotic.git  # download main repo
cd ~/xonotic
./all update -l best  # download all other repos (data + game logic, maps, etc.)


# build the dedicated server
./all compile dedicated
# this creates ~/xonotic/darkplaces/darkplaces-dedicated which should be copied to
# ~/xonotic/xonotic-local-dedicated

# create the server data directory
rm -rf .xonotic/
mdkir -p ~/.xonotic/data

# this file is overwritten from service/server.cfg at service startup
# so edits should be made to service/server.cfg
cp ~/Xonotic/server/server.cfg ~/.xonotic/data/server.cfg

# deploy service using mage. see magefiles/mage.go
