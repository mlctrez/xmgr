# build steps
# I had to build from source since my basement server distro is so old

# as super user, install build tools and add xonotic user
    sudo apt install build-essential autoconf libgmp3-dev zlib1g-dev libjpeg-turbo8-dev
    sudo adduser xonotic

# as xonotic user
sudo su - xonotic
# in home directory
curl -L -o !/xonotic-0.8.6.zip https://dl.unvanquished.net/share/xonotic/release/xonotic-0.8.6.zip
unzip xonotic-0.8.6.zip; mkdir ~/dist; mv xonotic-0.8.6.zip dist
cd ~/Xonotic

# build binary
make server
# this creates ~/Xonotic/xonotic-local-dedicated

rm -rf .xonotic/
mdkir -p ~/.xonotic/data

# this file is overwritten from service/server.cfg at service startup
# so edits should be made to service/server.cfg
cp ~/Xonotic/server/server.cfg ~/.xonotic/data/server.cfg

# deploy using mage
