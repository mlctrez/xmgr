# map naming
1. The map name displayed in the game does not match the filename of the map. When a client connects to download a map,
   does the server provide the file name from which the map was loaded?
2. Same question for specifying maps in g_maplist. Does the map name need to match the name of the .mapinfo file
   contained within the map zip file?  i.e. .xonotic/data/dlcache/oldnexuiz_revdm1.pk3 contains maps/revdm1.mapinfo
3. How does the 300 server have a customized message of the day screen? Coding changes?
